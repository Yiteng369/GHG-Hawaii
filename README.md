# CO2 Emissions Prediction Project

## Introduction
This repository contains code for the CO2 Emissions Prediction project, which utilizes various machine learning models to predict carbon dioxide emissions. This project is designed to help climate analysts forecast emission trends, assess mitigation strategies, and support policy-making to combat climate change.

## Project Structure
Below is the structure of the repository, detailing each major part:

- `preprocessing/`: Contains scripts for cleaning and preparing data, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
- `model_training/`: Includes Python scripts for training machine learning models.
- `hyper_parameter/`: Scripts for tuning the models to optimize performance.
- `prediction_error_analysis/`: Code for making predictions using the trained models and analyzing the results for accuracy and efficiency.

Each directory contains a detailed README file with specific instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost

You can install these with pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/CO2-prediction-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CO2-prediction-project
   ```

### Configuration
Modify the `config.py` files in each directory to suit your dataset paths and model parameters.

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data, run the following from the root directory:
```bash
python preprocessing/preprocess.py
```
This script will clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the dataset, saving the processed data into a new file for training.

### Model Training
To train the model with the preprocessed data:
```bash
python model_training/train_model.py
```
This will load the data, train the model using the specified parameters, and save the model for future predictions.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
For hyperparameter tuning, execute:
```bash
python hyper_parameter/tune_parameters.py
```
This script uses grid search or other optimization techniques to find the best parameters for the models, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.

### Prediction and Error Analysis
To make predictions and analyze model errors:
```bash
python prediction_error_analysis/predict.py
```
This will load the trained model, make predictions on new or test data, and generate error metrics and plots to assess the model's performance.
